	<p>In this section I will not tell you about playing bowling or nice party in the night club. This type of rest is very popular and
	quite often I participate in it, because in the life should be some variety. This rest is usual for most of the people, but
	I would like to share my experience from some other events, where sometimes crazy people take part. I advise to visit
	you at least one of them, because it is really awesome.</p>
