	<h3 align="center">Spain. 9-21 of August 2014.</h3><br>
	<p>In Spain we (me and my brother) have visited two biggest cities - Barcelona and Madrid, went to watch football, swam in the sea,
	ate Paella, went to <a href="#video">Corrida de Toros</a> and saw quite many other interesting places,
	so, now a bit more details. But if it is boring to read so long story you can straight away start watching 
	<a href="#foto">pictures</a> and <a href="#video">videos</a>.
	</p>	
	<p><b>Day 1 - came to Barcelona</b></p>
	<p>The flight was pretty nice - we were talking with my brother about everything and still had some time to sleep.
	Clara came to pick us up from the airport and we went to our hostel. Unfortunately, we had some issues with finding
	the hostel, but everything went good, thanks Clara, and after some time we went to research Barcelona. We walked 
	near famous stadium Camp Nou, visited nice small park with few fountains, "pineapple" trees and palms. Clara 
	showed us the buildings of University of Barcelona, including her faculty and then we went to the centre of Barcelona
	to the Plaza de Catalonia. It turned out that our hostel was not in the centre at all, however, the streets were quite 
	narrow there and buildings were not that high. We needed to use underground which turned out to be local train, but we 
	reached the centre quite fast using ticket T10 which is working for 1 zone and 10 times - it was enough for us.
	That part of the city was super busy - there were too many people and we finally felt that we are in Barcelona.
	We saw the fountain of Barcelona football club, went to drink some cold liquids and decided to go to the sea.
	Every day visit of the sea was our plan and we almost completed it. Near the sea there were even more people and 
	Stas even said that maybe here there are almost the same amount of people as in Tokyo. It was already evening and 
	there were a bit less people, small waves, very salty water compare to Black sea and warm wind - that was really nice.
	We ate and went back to hostel - we were really tired, but happy.

	<p><b>Day 2 (Barcelona) - Gothic Quarter, Montjuic hill</b></p>
	
	<p>First we went to the Plaza de Catalonia where we started our research of 
	<a href="http://youtu.be/gKcPeiM2nAs?list=PLmHe8Q-WpPQxygxQ6XAvFyMYzuOlnOzo1">Gothic Quarter</a>.
	Small narrow pedestrian streets with medieval architecture, huge amount of shops and tourists - you can
	find Gothic Quarter exactly like this today. One of the main places of this quarter is the Cathedral of the Holy
	Cross and Saint Eulalia which is the main cathedral of Barcelona. Saint Eulalia is one of city patronesses,
	exactly because of that this cathedral has her name. This cathedral was completely built in 1420 and 
	the hight of it's central tower is 70 meters.
	
	Later, we visited one of the beaches in Sant Marti and decided to go to the hill Montjuic. The hill has this name
	because of ancient Jewish cemetery. Our first sightseeing was Plaza de Espana with the beautiful fountain in the centre.
	There is an old arena for corrida there and on the top of the hill there is an amazing building of the national art museum
	which is easy to take as a cathedral. But the main place, from my point of view, is 
	<a href="http://youtu.be/g1isOeSAuA8?list=PLmHe8Q-WpPQxygxQ6XAvFyMYzuOlnOzo1">singing fountain Montjuic</a> which
	was created by the project of Catalan architect Carles Buigas. The fountain amazes by the dance with the music which
	is created by more than three thousands streams of water. Tired and satisfied we came back to hostel and slept like babies.  
	</p>	
   	
	<p><b>Day 3 (Barcelona) - sightseeing excursion, park Guell and museum of football club Barcelona.</b></p>

	<p>That day we decided to take a sightseeing bus. We saw how much more interesting places exist in Barcelona
	and what is compulsory to visit for us. Unfortunately, house Casa Mila was all under reconstruction and 
	we could not evaluate all of its advantages. House Casa Batllo is really interesting from the architecture point
	of view, but we decided not to go in. So, we visited park Guell - one more creation of famous architect 
	Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona and then we decided to go to Camp Nou - the stadium of the football club Barcelona where
	we went to the museum as well. We saw there huge amount of cups which were won by this team and also three golden boots and 
	four golden balls which we won by Lionel Messi.

	</p>	
	
	<p><b>Day 4 (Barcelona) - cathedral Sagrada Familia and mountain Tibidabo.</b></p>
	
	<p>During our sightseeing tour we saw <a href="http://youtu.be/gzaCo2ydd_8?list=PLmHe8Q-WpPQxygxQ6XAvFyMYzuOlnOzo1">cathedral Sagrada Familia</a>
	and decided that we must visit it.
	It is opening at 9 am and we woke up a bit earlier than normal and came there at this time together with Clara.
	But amount of tourists is just crazy, so we needed to stay in the queue for around one hour. And finally we got 
	the tickets, but they were only for entrance at 2 pm and we went to the sea. We swam and relaxed a bit on the beach and 
	went back. Cathedral Sagrada Familia or Expiatory Church of the Holy Family is really one of the most awesome places
	in Barcelona. The main architect is Guadi and this place was one of the main children in his life. The building started to 
	build in 1882, but the most interesting point is, that it is not finished yet. Very difficult to describe this cathedral 
	with the words, it is very unique, for example, one of the entrances is completely different to another one -
	one expresses the life end of the Jesus (Passion Facade) and another one the opposite - nativity (Nativity Facade).
	The third facade is still building and is a Glory Facade which asks every person with infinite questions like
	"Who are we?" and "Why are we here?". Then we went for the lunch where we tried soup gazpacho. After that Clara
	left us and we went to the highest point of Barcelona - 
	<a href="http://youtu.be/C94DltxIc5E?list=PLmHe8Q-WpPQxygxQ6XAvFyMYzuOlnOzo1">mountain Tibidabo</a>.
	The height is 512 meters and on the top
	there is Expiatory Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus which allows to go even higher to the level of 564 meters what we did.
	The view is really awesome - from one side sea and city and from another one - mountains. Actually we reached this mountain
	by an old funicular Tibidabo which was opened in 1901.

	<p><b>Day 5 - movement to Clara</b></p>
	<p>That day we were moving to Clara whose house is in the small town [name] near Barcelona.
	First Clara picked up her Canadian friend Janice from the airport, then us, and we all together went to Clara's place.
	Had great lunch, relaxed a bit, waited for Clara's parents who are very nice and positive people and moved to their
	another place which is near the sea. That time the weather was not so good, but it did not stop us and we of course
	went to swim. There was a little storm there with quite strong waves and the flow was moving us quite far away - 
	we were really excited!	
	</p>	
	
	<p><b>Day 6 - beach</b></p>
	<p>That was a relaxing day - no sightseeing, just swimming, sunbathing and playing volleyball. After lunch 
	we played domino and other boardgames. My plan was to leave tomorrow morning, but we liked
	our time with the girls so much, that decided to stay for half a day more. Thank you girls for such a nice time! 
	</p>
	
	<p><b>Day 7 - Spanish lunch, main cathedral of Barcelona, Columbus monument and train to Madrid.</b></p>
	<p>So, it was our last day near the sea which water is really salty compare to Black sea.
	That day instead of volleyball we were playing similar game to badminton, but with the wooden rackets and caoutchouc 
	ball which is very similar to the one for squash. During all the time that I have been on Barcelona beaches
	I did not find a place where I could rent a water scooter which was a big disappointment for me. But the idea 
	about the new business came up.
	When we were going to have a lunch Clara's family came - parents and grandparents. The result was a great feast - 
	we tried so many amazing dishes and were so full that cannot stand up straight away after it. Plus that was an 
	international Spanish table where you could hear Spanish, Catalan, Russian, English, French and even German.
	We thanked Clara and her family for this great welcome and went to Barcelona to have a look to some other sightseeing.
	We met my friend Anna who was also studying in Joensuu and went to see Barcelona again. Finally we came inside
	the main cathedral of Barcelona, walked through a nice street La Merce, saw Columbus monument and some other
	sightseeing. It was a surprise that we even saw the rain in Barcelona which last few hours. It might be that Catalonia 
	or maybe even whole Spain was crying because Anna was leaving to Ireland after few days for whole year.
	But our trip was going through Madrid which we reached by the night train which was very similar to our Russian ones, 
	but in the compartment there were not 4 persons, but 6. It was not that much space that sitting on the lowest desk was 
	almost impossible because the neck was already touching the second one. The train was full of international tourists, 
	actually the same as whole Barcelona. 
	</p>	
	
	<p><b>Day 8 (Madrid) - Royals palace and Catedral de la Almudena</b></p>
	
   <p>We came to Madrid and went to Cristina, the girl with whom I was studying English in England really long 
   time ago in the beginning of 2011. We threw our things, had a snack and went to research Madrid.
   During that day we saw Royals palace, opera, one of the main cathedrals of Almuden which we also visited.
   We had a lunch with nice specific dishes which were very similar to huge sandwiches and
   after that we went to Cristina's place because it was too hot. That's why Spanish people have siesta which 
   we spent at home. However, we could not get a good sleep in the train, so our siesta became so long 
   that we spent whole evening at Cristina's place. But there was one more reason to stay there - 
   we watched two football matches, with Zenit and Real, and for some weird reason Zenit won, but Real
   lost against Fiorentina, although it was just a friend's match.
   </p>	
	
	<p><b>Day 9 (Madrid) - Plaza de Cibeles, Prado museum and Corrida de Toros</b></p>
	
	<p>That day we visited one of the main squares of Madrid - Plaza de Cibeles where in the centre there is a 
	monument of goddess Cybele and near post office building with fascinating architecture where we could go on the top
	to view the city. The building of Spanish bank is definitely not worse and nicely complete the whole square.
	After that we decided to visit the main museum of Madrid and whole Spain Prado. Huge amount of paintings from different
	painters and almost everything in classic style which I like quite a lot. Then we went to the park Retiro which 
	is very silent and quite place in the centre of Madrid where you could also rent a boat to sail in the small lake.
	After taking a snack we went to 
	<a href="http://youtu.be/ukqGaDfGIqQ?list=PLmHe8Q-WpPQwuhApaeTxUnTBmrfTKo3Z1">Corrida de Toros</a> - bullfighting spectacle which is quite popular in Spain, but 
	in the same time prohibited in Catalonia. The bulls were small - only 400-500 kg, and it was really interesting to 
	watch how toreros try to kill them. These guys were not masters yet, so not everything was working for them, but it 
	made it special.
	</p>
	
	<p><b>Day 10 (Madrid) - lake near Madrid, squares Puerta del Sol and Plaza de Mayor</b></p>
	<p>It was "a bit" hot for us, so we decided to go to the "beach" of Madrid which is the closest lake
	situated around one hour by car from Madrid. We sunbathed and swam a bit and after lunch came back to Madrid to watch
	other sightseeing. First we visited square Puerta del Sol from where all the distances are calculated and then
	we went to the main square of Madrid - Plaza de Mayor. During our nice walk we have seen some city's sculptures - 
	monument for a blind person and also for a street cleaner.
	</p>		
	
	<p><b>Day 11 - football</b></p>
	<p>That day we were walking without Cristina because she needed to work. We saw Columbus monument, visited one cathedral 
	near Prado museum, saw national library, but all of our thoughts we dived into completely different world - in the 
	evening we were going to the first match of the 
	<a href="http://youtu.be/_mURjbpklF8?list=PLmHe8Q-WpPQwuhApaeTxUnTBmrfTKo3Z1">Spanish Super Cup final</a> - Real was playing against Atletiko. To visit
	Santiago Bernabeo - it is almost like to visit museum or opera. In spite of not that amazing match, the stadium and 
	atmosphere cannot be compared with anything else. Stadium can fit about 80 thousands of people and that day there were 
	no free places. It is quite difficult to explain how interesting it was there, it is better just to see it once.  
	</p>	
	
	<p><b>Day 12 - last day of our trip</b></p>
	<p>That day we visited main railway station from where we were going to Barcelona next day and also some other places.
	Met my friend Alfredo, walked with him near the main river of Madrid which is more like a little river because you cannot
	even talk about any water transportation there. That day we understood that we are a bit tired of our trip.
	Next day we went to Barcelona by very fast train which speed sometimes was reaching 300 km/h. From Barcelona we had
	a flight back to St.Petersburg.  
	</p>
	
	<p>What can I say, Spain is awesome, and I advise you to invite it!</p>
