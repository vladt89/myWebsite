	<h3 align="center">Japan. 19-29 of April 2014.</h3><br>	
	
	<p>
	My report of Japan is quite long, so if it is boring for you or you don't have the time to
	read it, you can just look at the <a href="#photo" >pictures</a>. I would also advise you to
	check out my <a href="#video" >videos</a> from Japan! They give you a better sense of the
	cities I visited than the pictures alone.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	On 18 of April I travelled by train from Saint-Petersburg to Moscow. I had a plane to catch
	from Sheremetyevo at 8 pm in the evening, so I had enough time to have a walk around Moscow
	to finish off my last minute holiday tasks which included buying a Japan Rail (JR) pass and
	buying some Japanese Yen. The price of the JR pass was around 200 Euros, but it really was 
	worth the money.  A single trip from Tokyo to Kyoto and back, for example would cost more 
	than the price for the JR pass.   
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I completely failed at my task of buying Yen because none of the five banks which I visited 
	had any Japanese currency. After all that running around, I finally set off to Sheremetyevo 
	by Aero-express, which is a comfortable train which goes from the center of Moscow to the 
	airport. I was flying to Tokyo via Beijing by Air China. Both planes I travelled on were really 
	big. There were nine people in each row and I was sitting in row 53 which was not the last. 
	So, there must have been at least 500 people on board and quite a lot of them were from Asia. 
	I didn’t feel completely comfortable, but it definitely was an unusual experience for me. 
	Changing planes in Beijing was quite funny because I almost overslept the time for boarding, 
	because I didn’t realise I needed to go through the security check again even though I was 
	only changing planes.
	</p>
	
	<p><b>1 day</b></p>	
	<p>At the airport in Tokyo, Narita I needed to fill in many forms including an immigration 
	form and a declaration and application for my JR Pass, but finally I managed to get everything 
	done and then took a train in the direction of my hostel. I met my Italian friend Gianbattista at 
	the hostel who I had met in England for the first time. Our hostel was not that good. It had thin 
	walls and not enough space, but it was very cheap which was a bonus. We threw our things in a corner 
	and headed off to the center of Tokyo even though it was already getting dark. My first impressions 
	were that Tokyo has very high buildings, lots of new Japanese cars and a fascinating sense of cleanness. 
	The first thing we did was to find a traditional Japanese restaurant, where the waitresses were in 
	traditional Japanese clothing. Japanese people don't really speak English, but are very friendly and 
	do all that they can to help. During our trip to Japan we ate in many different restaurants. Japanese 
	people eat a lot of fish and rice, however, they eat meat as well, but not that often. After dinner we 
	took a short walk, looked at the sky-scrapers (which are actually not that high), and then went to sleep 
	because the time difference of 5 hours finally started to kick in. It is interesting that Vladivostok 
	Saint-Petersburg has a seven hour difference from home, but Tokyo only has a five hour difference.

	<p><b>2 day</b></p>
	<p>I think that day two was one of the best days in Japan. First we went to the main railway 
	station in Tokyo to see it in day light.  We discovered that in Tokyo nobody seems to care about 
	beautiful old buildings.  Right next to the grand railway station there are many high tall office 
	buildings. From the station we walked to the Imperial Palace.  The current emperor of Japan lives in 
	the Imperial Palace. He does not, however, have any power anymore and the Prime Minister is now the main 
	Japanese leader.  In Japan, the people vote for the party that they support and then the party will decide 
	who will represent them in Parliament. In Tokyo, the mix of old and new is very interesting.  One minute 
	you are walking past some new sky-scrapers and the next you are in the national park amongst the trees and 
	the old Emperor’s residence. Another interesting thing is that our JR passes had the number 26 year written 
	on them.  It turned out that 26 represents the current year of the Emperor’s reign and is another way that 
	the Japanese write the date ie “2014”.
	</p>	
	
	<p>
	After that, we went to the oldest Buddhist temple in Tokyo at <i>Asakusa</i>. The old architecture of 
	Japan really amazes me, but even more beautiful was the process for burial services, which we stumbled 
	across by accident at a different temple while searching for the main one. Men in special clothing were 
	sitting near a statue of Buddha and singing. Next we went back to the center to meet my friend Kohjy who 
	I had met in Joensuu. During lunch we met with a Greek girl from Australia whose name was Mary and the four 
	of us spent the rest of the day together. We visited <i>Ryogoku</i> where the main sumo stadium is. Unfortunately, 
	in April there were no competitions and we did not get to see sumo wrestling in real life. Then we went to 
	the busiest intersection in the world, Shibuya. Even though it was a Sunday, there were still so many people. 
	This intersection is unique as it is a diagonal crossing. When the green pedestrian light is on, people cross 
	from all directions. Later in the evening we visited Tokyo Tower.  This tower is similar to the Eiffel Tower 
	in Paris and the Japanese are just as proud of it as the French are theirs. After being dazzled by wonderful 
	night views of Tokyo from the Tower we stopped at a traditional restaurant to drink sake and eat some dinner.
	As usual the menu consisted of some fish and a bit of chicken. We had a full and rich day and I was really 
	happy about that.

	<p><b>3 day</b></p>
	<p>
	Day three was a day of disappointments.  My impression of Japan was that it would be a country of new 
	technology and robots. Whilst they have the most amazing toilets in the world, equipped with seat warmers 
	and each waitress you come across carries an electronic notebook, that was about the extent of the technology 
	I saw and of course I wanted more. So, in search of some good technology, we went to the Innovation Museum 
	<i>Miraikan</i>, Unfortunately, even there I didn't see any robots.  
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In Tokyo the public transport system is excellent. The trains (local and subway) run so regularly that at 
	most there is a one minute delay between trains. On each platform there are marks on the ground which show 
	where the doors will be opened and Japanese people queue at the marks and wait for the train! After meeting 
	Mary and walking down "electric" street, we decided to try out the Robot Restaurant. I was hoping that maybe 
	there I would get to see some real robots, but unfortunately, it turned out that that the Robot Restaurant was 
	a show which was like a circus for adults. There were cute Japanese girls dancing on the pylons and fights 
	between the men dressed as robots. The guys liked it, so that made me happy.
	</p>

	<p><b>4 day</b></p>
	<p>Today we finally saw the sun in Tokyo. We therefore decided to take a sightseeing bus and have a look at 
	the Tokyo views from the upper deck of the bus. After that, we had a quick lunch in a Chinese cafe before 
	starting our trip to Sendai by fast train “Shinkansen” which can reach speeds of up to 300 km/h, although 
	you don't really feel it. Sendai is the capital of the north-east region of Japan and situated 50 km from 
	Fukushima. It was in this exact spot in 2011that there was the strong tsunami. We met with Gianbattista's 
	friend Kotomi, had something for dinner and then went to karaoke. Karaoke is really popular in Japan, 
	but a bit different to the way we imagined it would be. Each group of people had a private room, where you 
	can drink, eat and sing, of course. Because it is private, and there aren’t any strangers, you feel less shy 
	about singing.

	<p><b>5 day</b></p>
	<p>Today we spent the day on the cost of the Pacific Ocean with Kotomi and her boyfriend. We visited 
	a Buddhist temple and ate some more traditional Japanese food.  I think that I ate cow tongue with rice! 
	The weather was wonderful and we decided to go for a little boat trip between the islands in Sendai's bay. 
	The views were fascinating and I will remember the smell of the seawater and sound of the waves of the 
	Pacific Ocean for years to come. In the evening we went to a Teppanyaki restaurant where they give you 
	fresh food and in the middle of the table there is a special grill where you cook the food on your own.
	</p>	
	
	<p><b>6 day</b></p>
	<p>After spending the night at Kotomi's place we slowly started to move to our next point which was Osaka. 
	To get from Sendai to Osaka, we needed to go back to Tokyo and change trains there. The train trip was not 
	that long, but because we took our time, we only arrived in Osaka at around 6 pm. Although it was already 
	dark we went to see the main sight – the Osaka samurai castle.  It was really beautiful and the lighting 
	was so good that we could see everything. Later on we met Mary and headed up the <i>Umeda sky building</i> where 
	there is a rooftop observatory -  The Floating Garden Observatory. After that we decided to grab a bite to 
	eat. There was a piano at the restaurant and I gave a small concert to my friends. I can now say that I 
	have played piano in Japan!   
	</p>
	
	<p><b>7 day</b></p>
	<p>Based on the reports from other tourists about how nice Kyoto is, we decided to change our plans and 
	spend more time in Kyoto. This meant that we didn’t have a lot of time in Osaka, but we still managed 
	to visit Universal studios.  I was expecting to see something similar to a cinema museum but it turned 
	out to be an Attraction Park. Then we went to <i>oceanarium Kaiyukan</i>, saw many fish, crabs and other creatures. 
	Straight after that we left for Kyoto.  It did not take long as these cities are really close to each other. 
	On the Shinkansen, it only took around 10 minutes. Kyoto is amazing, what can I say. In the evening we walked 
	around the city and ate traditional Japanese pancake <i>okonomiyaki</i>.  It was so big that we could not finish it.   
	</p>
	
	<p><b>8 day</b></p>
	<p>Day eight was the hottest day of the tour.  We decided to rent bikes and explore Kyoto by bike. There are 
	many historical places in Kyoto, but we visited the main three and were really impressed. First we went to 
	<i>Kinkaku-ji</i> - Golden pavilion - the main Buddhist temple in Kyoto. Whilst it is really difficult to 
	describe in words, the temple and the gardens are almost from another world. The theory is that that this 
	temple represents heaven on earth and you truly feel that way when you are there. Our second sightseeing 
	stop was the summer residence of emperor the <i>castle Niji</i>. Inside the castle there are many beautiful paintings 
	on the walls. Many places in Japan do not allow you to wear shoes inside, so we spent a lot of the day taking 
	off and putting on our  shoes. The third sightseeing stop was another Buddhist temple which is situated on the 
	hill. Unfortunately the view was not great, but the temple was really interesting.  There we saw the love stone 
	and a large cemetery. By the end of the day I am sure that we must have cycled around 30 km. Even though my arms 
	and neck were burnt, I was really happy that we finally got some warm sun. In the evening we met up with my 
	friend Tomomi and then Mary joined us as well and we all went to a Club. The interesting thing in Kyoto is that 
	clubs open from 8 pm and close at 1 am, so everybody can get home on the trains. I really liked it.	
	</p>	
	
	<p><b>9 day</b></p>
	<p>Today was a day of farewells as it was the day that I said good bye to Gianbattista who was flying home. 
	I stayed one extra day in Japan. Thus we needed to get back to Tokyo so that he could fly out from there. 
	We ate a Japanese breakfast in the morning (tuna, rice, etc) as we were staying in a traditional Japanese hotel 
	and then we said good bye to Kyoto and made our way to Tokyo. We went to the airport quite early so that we weren’t 
	rushed. After parting with Gianbattista I walked to my hostel via the Buddhist temple in Asakusa which was nearby.
	</p>
	
	<p><b>10 day</b></p>
	<p>This was my last day in Japan.  The next morning I had to fly back to Moscow. I spent the day visiting 
	<i>Ryogoku</i> one more time and went to sumo museum, which was open, and then walked along the main river 
	<i>Sumida</i>. That day the Team Table Tennis World Championship started in Tokyo and of course I could not 
	miss that event. Unfortunately the Russians did not play well that day. Both teams lost. The men against 
	Poland and the girls against France, but I saw some of the best stars in the world play table tennis. 
	I was a bit anxious when I went to bed because I needed to wake up really early to catch my train. 
	I could not miss the train otherwise I might have missed the plane. However, thank God, everything went 
	well and I returned safely back home.
	</p>			
	
	<p>To all of you I would encourage you to see this interesting country!</p>
