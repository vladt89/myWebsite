            <p>
                During the summer 2015 I managed to visit Norway where I joined the hiking group from the
                <a href="http://www.vezdehod-tour.com.ua/">Club of soul trips Vezdehod</a>. Our group consisted of
                8 people where were 7 ukrainians and me. Despite all political and economical crises and wars we
                became really good friends and in the end of the hiking trip already did not know how we will be without
                each other in the future. Normally my trip reports describe every day, but in this case I decided to
                concentrate on the most bright and memorable moments. But if it is boring for you to read, I could
                offer you to watch the <a href="#photo">pictures</a> or <a href="#video">videos</a>.
            </p>

            <h4><i>Tell shortly about the hiking trip.</i></h4>
            <p>
                We met in Oslo, spent the night in camping and on the next day started to move by bus to the direction
                of the park Jotunheimen, where was our route. In total, we hiked more than 100 km, we had 10 full
                hiking days, we reached the highest point of Norway -
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galdhøpiggen">mountain Galdhøpiggen</a> (2469 m) and also
                were fascinated by the mountains view, fjords and waterfalls.

            First day, but in reality the evening on the first day. That day we started our trip from the level of 1000 m,
            needed to go over the mountain of 1750 meters and come to the "jumper" of two lakes. Yes, I think that
            this is one of the most beautiful places where we have been, I have not seen this anywhere else. So, we got the
            problems when we started to go down, when the rain started plus the actual route was enough extreme. This route
            could be extreme even in the dry weather, but we also had the backpacks around 15-25 kg, thus we were going
            down quite slowly and did not reach even the half way when it became dark and the rain became stronger. Ow yes,
            strong wind came to help the rain as well. My new tracking shoes were absolutely not ready for this rain and
            were completely wet. Plus because it was just the first day, I did not understand yet which type of clothes I
            should wear in the evening in Norway mountains, but changing the clothes under the rain felt as stupid idea.
            I don't know how other participants were feeling, but for me it was not that sweet. So, we were lucky and
            found small place in the middle of the mountain where we managed to put the tents. Have you ever tried to
            put the tents when there is a heavy rain and strong wind? What about when your tent pegs cannot go inside
            because everywhere there are only stones? Yes, it was already dark and unfortunately I prepared poorly and
            my lamp did not provide almost any light. Finally, we went inside the tent, all wet and frozen, started to
            make the warm tea and at some point the instructor's hand came inside our tent. The hand was holding the plate
            with small peaces of the product that we did not know that time. There was the order to take the piece for
            each of us and eat. That day was my first time when I ate ginger and most probably it saved me from the sickness.
            Thanks to our instructor Kolya! That day I had an idea to go back because if all other days had been like this,
            it would have been fanny (not that funny). But, for my surprise, nobody had this type of thoughts, thus we went forward and had
            a great time in Norway mountains!

            <p>
                In Norway there is a lot of water - beautiful lakes and stormy rivers. And, of course, it happened,
                that we needed to go to another side of the river. In many places we were jumping from one stone to another one
                and in some places we had suspension bridges. That was completely new impression for me because I have never
                crossed stormy river on the suspension bridge with the backpack. That was really cool!
                <a href="https://youtu.be/8mdub1ZbHYk?t=5m35s">This is how it looks on the camera GoPro</a>. Yes,
                and we also have seen where snow melts and creates the river. Sounds that it is not really cool,
                but the things which nature creates there cannot be described with words.
            </p>

            <h4><i>What was the temperature during your hiking trip?</i></h4>
            <p>
                Temperature was from -3 to 10 degrees. Instructors were saying that this is normal temperature for the
                Norway mountains in July. So, during daytime with small wind and sun temperature can reach maybe 13 degrees,
                but not more. In general, in t-shirt only our instructor Kolya can hike. During the night the temperature
                could easily go until zero, so my advice is - take normal warm sleeping bag and not summer one that I
                decided to take. There were couple of days when our tents were 200 meters away from the snow, and, thanks God,
                we did not need to sleep on the snow. But believe me, during the summer in July there is enough snow
                in Norway mountains - it is not Carpathian or Crimea.
            </p>

            <h4><i>Did you have any disappointments in this hiking trip?</i></h4>
            <p>
                Unfortunately yes. One of the main events on this hiking trip was our rise to the highest point of
                Norway - mountain Galdhøpiggen (2469 m). That was radial trip, so we were going without backpacks and
                took with us only water and some snacks. We started our way from 1300 meters where we had our camp.
                You can count that we needed to make 1200 meters up and same amount down. Even without the backpacks
                this is not that light. I was waiting the moment when I could stay on the highest point of Norway and
                watch all the beauties of this amazing country. But unfortunately we were not that lucky that day and
                already in the middle of the rise we were in the cloud. What does it mean? Fog, just fog and the fact
                that you cannot recognize the person after 50 meters and after 100 you don't see him at all. So, what
                could we see from the mountain? Nothing. That was really a big disappointment. However, I am happy
                that we reached that highest point and raised to the Galdhøpiggen because when I was in Oslo I heard
                that there is too much snow there and it is better not to go there. And I can agree that there was
                enough snow - last 200-300 meters we were hiking in the snow. Couple of pictures from these places
                remind me about the icemen movies, but, of course, it was not too hard in our case, but wet snow and coldness
                did not allow us to forget about them. On the way back our group had quite a lot of fun going down
                on our booties in the snow.
            </p>

            <h4><i>What is so cool in hiking if it is that cold, wet and hard?</i></h4>
            <p>
                Maybe after my story about the beauties of Norway you would say: "Which hiking trip?! I would rather
                lie on the beach near the sea!" But this is absolutely another type of relaxing. What is so
                fascinating there? First of all, you go away from civilization and I am talking about all these
                phones, computers, TVs and other devices which are around us. In hiking trip you don't have it and it is
                really great, it can allow you to understand how much more important is communication with the people and
                nature. Second, in the hiking trip it is always not that easy, but you go together with the group,
                help each other, go through the difficulties together. It makes you stronger psychologically and
                physically. Third, people in hiking trips are always great - they are kind and responsive people with whom
                it is very easy to find general language. During several days you become very close and start to know
                them maybe even better than your best friends because you spend with them a lot of time, go the same route,
                prepare the food and are glad these little victories when the instructor says "We came, set the camp!".
                In general, especially in this hiking trip, we had really great group, were discussing all the topics
                which exist, solving different mathematical and logical puzzles, played different games, sang songs
                and shared the impressions. I still remember that puzzle about the man in the forest with the broken neck:)

                country!</i></p>
