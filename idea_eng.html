	<h4 align="center">My principles</h4>
	<p>Every person has his own ideals and preferences. I try to live using some general principles. For example, I think that truth is
	quite important, although in some special cases it is better to lie that the person feel better... One of my favourite books is "Two captains"
	by Kaverin and I advise to all read it.
	</p>
	<p>"Struggle and search, find and not surrender" - one of the phrases, which influence on my life ideology. Now I try to follow this statement.
	Every person should have an aim and if the person does not have it I would say that it is quite bad. We should slowly move for realizing 
	our purposes and wishes even if we feel that it is impossible. Everything is possible nowadays.
	</p>
 	<p>
 	Moreover, I believe people should live with whole life: you need to try everything, what you have time and possibility for!
 	You should be active that you can say later: "Did you remember how ... !?" It is so wonderful to laugh at some boolshit events, laugh stories, which
 	came into our life...
 	</p> 	
	<p>The time flies so fast that you can't just sit and wait for the next day. Just do it now!
	<p>P.s. I would like to add that the original version of this was written around 2008, when I have just created the website. This is so cool
	that now in 2013 I could say that it didn't change at all! I just would like to add one little thing. I also try to live that people
	who know me can say: "Wow, this is life! How can he do that? I want the same!"</p> 
	<p>Good Luck to All!:)
